# OfDreamSim
An openFrameworks project that attempts to visualise data taken from the CAP sleep database. 
The aim of this project is to provide a visual representation of the sleep process, created from data provided by the CAP Sleep Database. 
By selecting a participant the mesh onscreen will grow, shrink and move in relation to the stage of sleep the participant is in. 
The colour of the mesh is determined by the 'dream seed' where, the program will select random colours from a portion of the image provided. 
As the subject falls deeper asleep, the portion of the image that is analysed will increase. Enjoy
